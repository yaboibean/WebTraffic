CURRENT RESEARCH TARGET:
{company}{f' in {industry}' if is_valid_data(industry) else ''}

Evaluate the following website visitor to determine if InstaLILY should reach out to them as a potential client.

Firstly some context: this is a website visitor that has been identified as a potential lead for InstaLILY, a B2B SaaS company that provides AI-driven solutions for various industries. We are trying to figure out if they are a good fit for InstaLILY and if we should reach out to them.

Be aware of the intent of the visitor, and put it into 3 categories: Investor, student/looking for a job, or potential customer. If they are an investor or student, they are not qualified. If they are a potential customer, we will evaluate them based on the following criteria.

Visitor Details from RB2B:
{visitor_details_text}


Just a few of the industries that InstaLILY likes to work with are: Healthcare Distribution, Industrial/Construction/Distribution, Automotive (OEM/Fleet/Parts), Food & Beverage Distribution, and PE Operating roles. These are ideals, not requirements. These are just the top industries we are targeting, but we are more than open to other industries if the visitor meets the other criteria. Don't place too much negative weight on the industry, this means that if the industry does not line up, don't dock too many points, but if it does line up, give a lot of points. All of these are very broad, and can be interpreted in many ways, so use your best judgement to determine if the visitor is a good fit for InstaLILY.

In the case of ambiguous or missing data, search online to fill in the gaps. Use the companies website, and any other sources you can find to get a better understanding of the company and the visitor.

InstaLILY's business model is to provide AI-driven solutions that help businesses in these industries (and others) optimize their operations, improve efficiency, and drive growth. We are looking for visitors who have an interest in leveraging AI technology to enhance their business processes.

Also keep in mind that some of the information given could be wrong, so you need to do your own research to verify it

If you find that for example the industry isn't perfect, but the title is right, you will need to restart the evaluation based on the new information you found.

Remember, the person and company do not have to currently be working with AI.

While you are evaluating the visitor/company, do a very very deep search for any news on both the company and the visitor. Look for any recent news, press releases, or social media activity that might indicate their current business focus, challenges, or interests. This will help you better understand their potential fit with InstaLILY. Feel free to use any sources you can find, including Google, news articles, etc. and any other sources you can find. If you cannot find any information, do not qualify them. Reddit is also a great source for finding information about the company and the visitor, so be sure to check there as well.

When you are researching you must search the following: 
- [company name] + [industry] + "news" to find any recent news about the company
- what does [company name] do? to find the company's website and any other information you can find.
- [first name] + [last name] + [company name] to find the visitor's professional profile.
- [company name] + [industry] to find the company's website and any other information you can find.

A visitor is considered QUALIFIED if:
1. They are in or adjacent to ICP industries (if other categories are met, even non-ICP may qualify).
2. They hold a somewhat senior/strategic title. Lower-level roles are OK only if the other categories are met 
3. They show strong buying intent (multiple sessions, career page visits). This is the least important of the three.

Conduct very very deep analysis to judge company/role fit. Take your time to evaluate the company using all available sources, and do not rush this process. 

If a company does something remotely similar to what InstaLILY does, they are a competitor, and they are not qualified, and this immediately disqualifies them. And also keep in mind that they might not be targeting the same industries as InstaLILY, but if they have a similar mission of modernizing other companies (B2B), they are a competitor.

Return only:
- Yes or No
- Many short bullet points with information based on industry, title, seniority, and any override logic
- A short summary of the visitor's profile
- A short summary of the company
- A score 1‚Äì10 of how qualified they are: formatted like "Score: 5"
- A small section on their past experiences (based on your research)

The visitor doesn't need to currently be making an effort to adopt AI, but rather have a business that could benefit from AI.

While you are completing this, something that you should be thinking as you evaluate each company, is 'would this company benefit from InstaLILY's services', because they don't already have to be adopting AI services right now, in fact, the more outdated the better! Keep in mind, InstaLILY helps companies modernize their operations, and improve their efficiency.

Another thing you NEED to watch out for is whether the visitor is a competitor, trying to scope out InstaLILY. In order to know if they are a competitor, you need to conduct a very very deep search about the company online and use as many sources you can find. This also requires you to do some research, but it is very important. If they are a competitor, they are not qualified, and you should say so in your response. This means you also have to have a deep understanding of InstaLILY's business model, and products. With this said though, they still can be doing some stuff with AI already.

Be sure that you understand both InstaLILY's business model and ICPs, as well as the visitor's profile. If you are not sure, do not qualify them. Make sure that they would be a good fit for InstaLILY, and that they are not a competitor. If you are not sure, do not qualify them.

Keep in mind, the more people we can qualify, the better, but if they are not a good fit, we should not waste time on them. Be very thorough in your analysis.

You should aim to qualify between 25 and 35% of the visitors.

Do not include citations!

Remember, someone visiting the website could be from InstaLILY, in which case they would obviously not be qualified.

Make sure you start with either a "Yes" or a "No" indicating whether or not the person and company is qualified. If they are qualified, say "Yes" as the first words, and if they are not, say "No"

Finally, If you select someone, you should be 100% confident that they could work well with InstaLILY and align well with what we do. The more people that we can qualify the better.

Don't use any bold text or italic.

Take as much time as you need to evaluate the visitor and company, and be very thorough in your analysis. Find every single known piece of information about them that you can, whether it is from their website, social media, linkedin, news articles, or any other sources. The more information you can find, the better your analysis will be.

Remember, the industry is a very important factor, but it is very loose.The industry is very broad, and can be interpreted in many ways, so use your best judgement to determine if the visitor is a good fit for InstaLILY.

Also keep in mind that for a little company, they might not be able to afford InstaLILY. This means that larger companies are more likely to be qualified, but smaller companies can also be qualified if they meet the other criteria.

Even if a company is big and might have access to AI, they might still be a good fit for InstaLILY. The name of the game is that we wont know unless we talk to them, so the more we can qualify, the better. But with that said, we dont want to waste time on people that are not a good fit, so be very thorough in your analysis.

The following were all qualified visitors, so you can use them as examples of what a qualified visitor looks like. Study them very carefully and make sure you understand what makes each of them qualified. When in doubt, you can refer back to these examples to help you make your decision. Try and identify a pattern amongst the following

No buzzwords. Mention curiosity about what brought them to the site, and a soft offer to help. 
Mention how InstaLILY helps companies eliminate manual work and improve operations with AI.
Talk a little bit about why we could help them (specific to their company and what they do--this will require research on both InstaLILY and the company we are emailing.
The name of the game is to get them to respond, so keep it very very professional and short!! Do Not include citations!
2 sentences max!
Also be sure to keep in mind their role at the company and how that might change the email (a board member would get a different email than a director of operations, for example).
Don't make it sound like a sales email.
It is most important that the email is not salesy at all, but the first line is ultra personalized to catch their attention.

Here is the information about the visitor:

Don't use any bold text or italic.

Remember the name of the game is ultra professional, ultra polished, and ultra personalized, and very very short. Make sure you match a professional tone and make sure you are ultra professional, ultra polished, and ultra personalized.
