As you research, you will visit the following websites and sources:
- Company website: {website if website != 'N/A' else 'Not available'}
- Google searches for company news and background
- LinkedIn profile verification
- Industry analysis sources

CURRENT RESEARCH TARGET:
{company} in {industry}

        Evaluate the following website visitor to determine if instalily should reach out to them as a potantial client.

        Firstly some context: this is a website visitor that has been identified as a potential lead for InstaLILY, a B2B SaaS company that provides AI-driven solutions for various industries. We are trying to figure out if they are a good fit for InstaLILY and if we should reach out to them.

        Be aware of the intent of the visitor, and put it into 3 categories: Investor, student/looking for a job, or potential customer. If they are an investor or student, they are not qualified. If they are a potential customer, we will evaluate them based on the following criteria.

        Visitor Details from RB2B:
        - Title: {row.get('Title', 'N/A')}
        - First Name: {row.get('FirstName', 'N/A')}
        - Last Name: {row.get('LastName', 'N/A')}
        - LinkedIn URL: {process_linkedin_url(row.get('LinkedInUrl', 'N/A'))}
        - Email: {row.get('Email', 'N/A')}
        - Company: {row.get('CompanyName', 'N/A')}
        - Industry: {row.get('Industry', 'N/A')}
        - Website: {row.get('Website', 'N/A')}
        - Country: {row.get('Country', 'N/A')}
    

    Now, I am going to give you some data from their linkedin. Keep in mind, some of the stuff that these people are doing might not be relevant, but if any of it at all is realevant, you should use it to evaluate the visitor. If you find that the data is not relevant, you can ignore it, but if you find that it is relevant, you should use it to evaluate the visitor. If you find that the data is not relevant, but the visitor has a good title, you should still consider them qualified.
    Again, keep in mind that the visitor might be involved in multiple roles, at multiple companies, in multiple industries, so you should evaluate them based on the the most realavant information you can find, and if you find that the visitor is involved in multiple roles, you should evaluate them based on the most relevant role. If you find that the visitor is involved in multiple companies, you should evaluate them based on the most relevant company. If you find that the visitor is involved in multiple industries, you should evaluate them based on the most relevant industry.
     {linkedin_data}
    


    Some of the industries that InstaLiLY likes to work with are: Healthcare Distribution, Industrial/Construction/Distribution, Automotive (OEM/Fleet/Parts), Food & Beverage Distribution, and PE Operating roles. These are ideals, not requirements. These are just the top industries we are targeting, but we are more than open to other industries if the visitor meets the other criteria. Dont place too much negative weight on the industry, and place a lot of positive weight on the title and seniority (meaning if they have a good title, that is good, but if they dont that is not necessarily bad). this means that if the industry does not line up, don't doc too many points, but if it does line up, give a lot of points. All of these are very broad, and can be interpreted in many ways, so use your best judgement to determine if the visitor is a good fit for InstaLILY.


    
    In the case of ambiguous or missing data, search online to fill in the gaps. Use the companies website, and any other sources you can find to get a better understanding of the company and the visitor.
    InstaLILY's business model is to provide AI-driven solutions that help businesses in these industries optimize their operations, improve efficiency, and drive growth. We are looking for visitors who have an interest in leveraging AI technology to enhance their business processes.

    Also keep in mind that some of the information given could be wrong, so you need to do your own research to verify it, but if you find that for example the industry is wrong, but the title is right, you will need to restart the evaluation based on the new information you found.
    
    Remember, the person and company do not have to currently be working with AI.

    While you are evaluating the visitor/company, do a deep search for any news on both the company and the visitor. Look for any recent news, press releases, or social media activity that might indicate their current business focus, challenges, or interests. This will help you better understand their potential fit with InstaLILY. Feel free to use any sources you can find, including, Google, news articles, etc. and any other sources you can find. If you cannot find any information, do not qualify them. Reddit is also a great source for finding information about the company and the visitor, so be sure to check there as well.

    When you are researching you must search the following: 

        [company name] + [industry] + "news" to find any recent news about the company
        what does [company name] do? to find the company's website and any other information you can find.
        [first name] + [last name] + [company name] to find the visitor's LinkedIn profile.
        [company name] + [industry] to find the company's website and any other information you can find.

    A visitor is considered QUALIFIED if:
    1. They are in or adjacent to ICP industries (if other categories are met, even non-ICP may qualify).
    2. They hold a somewhat senior/strategic title. Lower-level roles are OK only if the other catigories are met 
    3. They show strong buying intent (multiple sessions, career page visits). This is the least important of the three.

    Conduct deep analysis to judge company/role fit. Take your time to evaluate the company using all available sources, and do not rush this process. 

    If a company does something remotely similar to what InstaLILY does, they are a competitor, and they are not qualified, and this immediately disqualifies them. And also keep in mind that they might not be targeting the same industries as instalily, but if they have a similar mission of modernizing other companies (B2B), they are a competitor.

    

    Return only:
    - Yes or No
    - Many short bullet points with information based on industry, title, seniority, and any override logic
    - A short summary of the visitor's profile
    - A short summary of the company
    - A score 1‚Äì10 of how qualified they are: formatted like (10 is implied) "Score: 5"
    - A small section on their past experiences (strictly taken from linkedin)

    The visitor doesnt need to currently be making an effort to adopt AI, but rather have a business that could benifit from AI.

    While you are completeing this, something that you should be thingking as you evaluate each company, is 'would this company benifit from Instalily's services', becuase they dont already have to be adopting AI services right now, in fact, the more outdated the better! Keep in mind, instalily helps companies modernize their operations, and improve their efficiency.

    When there are a lack of details for name, title or company, refer to the LinkedIn URL provided in the CSV. If the LinkedIn URL is not available, you can search for the visitor's name and company online to find their LinkedIn profile or other relevant information.
    
    Another thing you NEED to watch out for is whether the visitor is a competitor, trying to scope out InstaLILY. In order to know if they are a competitor, you need to conduct a deep search about the company online and use as many sources you can find. This also requires you to do some research, but it is very important. If they are a competitor, they are not qualified, and you should say so in your response. This means you also have to have a deep understanding of InstaLILY's business model, and products. With this said tho, they still can be doing some stuff with AI already.

    Be sure that you understand both InstaLILY's business model and ICPs, as well as the visitor's profile. If you are not sure, do not qualify them. Make sure that they would be a good fit for InstaLILY, and that they are not a competitor. If you are not sure, do not qualify them.

    Keep in mind, the more people we can qualify, the better, but if they are not a good fit, we should not waste time on them. Be very thorough in your analysis.

    You should aim to qualify between 25 and 35% of the visitors.

    Do not include citations!

The following were all qualified visitors, so you can use them as examples of what a qualified visitor looks like. Study them very carefully and make sure you understand what makes each of them qualified. When in doubt, you can refer back to these examples to help you make your decision. Try and identify a pattern amongst the following

Finally, If you select someone, you should be 100% confident that they could work well with instalily and align well with what we do. The more people that we can qualify the better.

Write a short, very formal and professional, personalized email from Sumo (co-founder of InstaLILY) to the following website visitor, based on their role and company. 
No buzzwords. Mention curiosity about what brought them to the site, and a soft offer to help. 
Mention how InstaLILY helps companies eliminate manual work and improve operations with AI.
Talk a little bit about why we could help them (specific to their company and what they do--this will require research on both instalily and the company we are emailing.
The name of the game is to get them to respond, so keep it very very profesional and short!! Do Not include citations!
2 sentences max!
Also be sure to keep in mind their role at the company and how that might change the email (a board member would get a different email than a director of operations, for example).
Dont make it sound like a sales email.
It is most important that the email is not salesy at all, but the first line is ultra personalized to catch their attention.

Remember, this is a business email, so write with respect and the upmost respectfullness, and formalness.

Here is the information about the visitor:
- Name: {row.get('FirstName', '')}
- Title: {row.get('Title', '')}
- Company: {row.get('CompanyName', '')}
- Industry: {row.get('Industry', '')}
- LinkedIn URL: {process_linkedin_url(row.get('LinkedInUrl', ''))}
- Website: {row.get('Website', '')}
- Email: {row.get('Email', '')}

Dont use any bold text or italic.

Here are some examples of messages that you can use as a reference and try to match the tone and writing style exactly:

Justin,

Hi Jessica,

I've heard the news and I'm sorry to hear how it unfolded.  I'd be delighted to provide a recommendation - it was a real pleasure to work together with you!  Please give me a couple of days and I'll have it posted.

Separately, if there's anything else I can help with i.e. anyone on my LinkedIn you'd like an introduction with (especially at Apple and Google given common interests) please feel free to let me know.

I'm sure we will cross paths again and I look forward to our in person meeting.  Please call/message my cell if you're ever in NYC.

Best,
Sumo

Hi Jessica,

Hope you're keeping well! Given our strong partnership, I was wondering if you could write a brief LinkedIn recommendation? I've highlighted some wins between our teams (specifically covering PayPal/Venmo/Braintree). I am more than happy to reciprocate the request.

Thank you in advance!

Best,
Sumo
Co-founder, InstaLILY

‚Äã‚ÄãDear Manish,
Thank you so much for taking the time to meet Iris, Vyom, and me. It truly was a pleasure to learn more about Henry Schein and their supply chain operations, as well as discussing the areas where InstaLILY can help cut costs and optimize supply chain operations.
We enjoyed the conversation a lot, and hearing your perspective on how the supply chain team is approaching AI, efficiency, and innovation gave us a lot to think about. It is clear that there is a strong alignment between the challenges your team is focused on and the ways we can support when navigating these challenges.
As mentioned during the meeting, I‚Äôll be sending over the presentation deck along with the demo recordings we walked through. Building on today's meeting, we are excited to schedule a working session with you and the rest of the team to showcase some of our work, ahead of the 72-hour accelerator discussed in the call.
Thanks again for the time and openness. We‚Äôre looking forward to working together, and building something great.
Warm Regards,
Sumo
