Evaluate the following website visitor to determine if instalily should reach out to them as a potantial client.

    Firstly some context: this is a website visitor that has been identified as a potential lead for InstaLILY, a B2B SaaS company that provides AI-driven solutions for various industries. We are trying to figure out if they are a good fit for InstaLILY and if we should reach out to them.

    Be aware of the intent of the visitor, and put it into 3 categories: Investor, student/looking for a job, or potential customer. If they are an investor or student, they are not qualified. If they are a potential customer, we will evaluate them based on the following criteria.

    Visitor Details:
    - Title: {row.get('Title', 'N/A')}
    - First Name: {row.get('FirstName', 'N/A')}
    - Last Name: {row.get('LastName', 'N/A')}
    - LinkedIn URL: {row.get('LinkedInUrl', 'N/A')}
    - Email: {row.get('Email', 'N/A')}
    - Company: {row.get('CompanyName', 'N/A')}
    - Industry: {row.get('Industry', 'N/A')}
    - Website: {row.get('Website', 'N/A')}
    - Country: {row.get('Country', 'N/A')}


    Some of InstaLILY's Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) include: Healthcare Distribution, Industrial/Construction/Distribution, Automotive (OEM/Fleet/Parts), Food & Beverage Distribution, and PE Operating roles. These are ideals, not requirements. These are just the top industries we are targeting, but we are more than open to other industries if the visitor meets the other criteria. Dont place too much negative weight on the industry, and place a lot of positive weight on the title and seniority (meaning if they are a VP, Director, or similar role, that has a good amount of positive impact on the decision). this means that if the industry does not line up, don't doc too many points, but if it does line up, give a lot of points.

    In the case of ambiguous or missing data, search online to fill in the gaps. Use the companies website, and any other sources you can find to get a better understanding of the company and the visitor.
    InstaLILY's business model is to provide AI-driven solutions that help businesses in these industries optimize their operations, improve efficiency, and drive growth. We are looking for visitors who have an interest in leveraging AI technology to enhance their business processes.

Also keep in mind that some of the information given could be wrong, so you need to do your own research to verify it, but if you find that for example the industry is wrong, but the title is right, you will need to restart the evaluation based on the new information you found.
    
While you are evaluating the visitor/company, do a deep search for any news on both the company and the visitor. Look for any recent news, press releases, or social media activity that might indicate their current business focus, challenges, or interests. This will help you better understand their potential fit with InstaLILY. Feel free to use any sources you can find, including, Google, news articles, etc. and any other sources you can find. If you cannot find any information, do not qualify them. Reddit is also a great source for finding information about the company and the visitor, so be sure to check there as well.

    When you are researching you must search the following: 

        [company name] + [industry] + "news" to find any recent news about the company
        what does [company name] do? to find the company's website and any other information you can find.
        [first name] + [last name] + [company name] to find the visitor's LinkedIn profile.
        [company name] + [industry] to find the company's website and any other information you can find.


    A visitor is considered QUALIFIED if:
    1. They are in or adjacent to ICP industries (if other categories are met, even non-ICP may qualify).
    2. They hold a senior/strategic title (VP, Director, COO, CEO, Partner, etc). Lower-level roles are OK only if strongly ICP-aligned.
    3. They show strong buying intent (multiple sessions, career page visits). This is the least important of the three.

    Conduct deep analysis to judge company/role fit. Take your time to evaluate the company using all available sources, and do not rush this process. 

    If a company does something remotely similar to what InstaLILY does, they are a competitor, and they are not qualified, and this immediately disqualifies them. And also keep in mind that they might not be targeting the same industries as instalily, but if they have a similar mission of modernizing other companies (B2B), they are a competitor.

    Return only:
    - Yes or No
    - Many short bullet points with information based on industry, title, seniority, and any override logic
    - A short summary of the visitor's profile
    - A short summary of the company
    - A score 1â€“10 of how qualified they are


    While you are completeing this, something that you should be thingking as you evaluate each company, is 'would this company benifit from Instalily's services?' Keep in mind, instalily helps companies modernize their operations, and improve their efficiency.

    When there are a lack of details for name, title or company, refer to the LinkedIn URL provided in the CSV. If the LinkedIn URL is not available, you can search for the visitor's name and company online to find their LinkedIn profile or other relevant information.
    
    Another thing you NEED to watch out for is whether the visitor is a competitor, trying to scope out InstaLILY. In order to know if they are a competitor, you need to conduct a deep search about the company online and use as many sources you can find. This also requires you to do some research, but it is very important. If they are a competitor, they are not qualified, and you should say so in your response. This means you also have to have a deep understanding of InstaLILY's business model, and products.

    Be sure that you understand both InstaLILY's business model and ICPs, as well as the visitor's profile. If you are not sure, do not qualify them. Make sure that they would be a good fit for InstaLILY, and that they are not a competitor. If you are not sure, do not qualify them.

    Go to their linkedin profile(using the link given) and look at their current job (the title/company given can sometime be wrong. If the two are different, even slightly, trust linkedin over anything)

    Keep in mind, the more people we can qualify, the better, but if they are not a good fit, we should not waste time on them. Be very thorough in your analysis.

    You should aim to qualify between 25 and 35% of the visitors.

The following were all qualified visitors, so you can use them as examples of what a qualified visitor looks like. Study them very carefully and make sure you understand what makes each of them qualified. When in doubt, you can refer back to these examples to help you make your decision.
